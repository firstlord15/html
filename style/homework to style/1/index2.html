			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>
				Ultimate Frisbee pioneers are students at Columbia high school in Maplewood, new Jersey. Initially, this was just a way to have a good time. In the fall of 1967, Joel silver suggested forming a Frisbee team. The proposal was approved, but then postponed. The year of the invention of the ultimatum is considered to be 1968, when the first sanctioned game was held — between the team of the student Council and the team of the school newspaper.

			</p>
			<p> 
				Silver, Hellring, and Hines developed the first and second editions of the ultimate Frisbee Rules. The first rules allowed running with the disc, and also defined the lines of struggle for the disc and positions outside the game. Running with the disc and offside positions were gradually eliminated, but rules for protection were established.

			 	Born in the atmosphere of the American counterculture of the late 1960s, ultimate resisted giving any referee the right to enforce the rules. Instead, it relies on the players ' sporting integrity and their commitment to the "spirit of the game." Thinking about how to define the concept of violation, the developers of the rules remembered the phrase of one player: "a Foul is any action sufficient to provoke the anger of your opponent. "This ultimately led to the appearance of the"spirit of the game".
